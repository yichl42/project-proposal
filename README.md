## Abstract

> No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." (3) "Consider that .... This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."

Our main question is the relationship between outbreak and reduction over time.

We are concerned with several outbreaks of covid and the pattern of reduction of covid after outbreaks.

Considering that covid is widespread and harms people's health, this is important because analyzing and understanding the reasons and patterns of outbreaks can help people learn more about covid.
Accordingly, we plan to record the data and analyze it, and we hope that we can help the government make decisions. 


## Keywords

> 3-5 keywords that summarize your project.
(e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; Gen Z; times-series data") 

Pandemic, Coronavirus, Covid-19, Health, Time-series data

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)

1. When are the top-3 most daily new cases that occurred 
    
2. After the first covid breakout, when do daily new cases start to reduce
    
3. Is the time between outbreaks related to seasons?
    
4. Is the time used to reduce the covid cases related to the country?
	
5. Is the relationship between the number of new people per day and the number of deaths per day proportional.
    
We want to do research on the relationship between the covid outbreaks and seasons, so we need to record the time of each breakout, and we need to analyze the time of breakout, and relate it to seasons.
    
Without considering the policy, we would like to know whether the decrease in the number of new people per day is related to seasonal changes or climate, so besides recording the time of outbreaks, we also record the time of reduction at the same time. We want to know if the death is related to time or the daily new cases.
    
Other than this, we need to consider the different situation of each individual countries, so besides analyzing the seasons we need to consider the relationship between the outbreaks and the locations of countries in order to help people to learn more about covid and help the government to make decisions.
